You started the night with a letter to me, where you asked me to marry you. I laughed, oh, how I laughed. We spoke of this wedding, how it would be at the beach, how everyone would be required to wear swimsuits, how [[Uncle Harry-&gt;uncleHenry]] would look in that speedo (we don&#x27;t even know if Uncle Harry exists). 

You came to visit me in the [[morning-&gt;morning]], the morning of our honeymoon perhaps, and you gave me your heart. You should not have given me your heart, and I wish you never did, because it was far too beautiful for me to have. Little did I know, you would be leaving me again, to return to your dreary existence. Little did I know, I would want you to come back, again and again and again.

And so we did try, when you were hundreds of miles away from me, under the swaying palm trees (I hope their shade kissed you the way you deserved to be kissed). I was under the orange trees of an aging city, when I asked you to come visit.

You just texted me. You just texted me as I was writing this letter. You said you would watch the video when you get back from work, that these next few days will be busy. You said you&#x27;re sorry you&#x27;re always so busy.

Ah, fuck. I&#x27;m about to break your heart. You will watch that video, and you will break, because I am terrible and selfish, and I should have let you go before either of us fell for each other.

I&#x27;m sorry I changed my mind. I&#x27;m sorry I have to say goodbye. I am falling in love with you, and I cannot fall in love with you. I cannot fall in love with someone I cannot touch or see anymore. You are too far from me, and I cannot jump off a cliff when I can&#x27;t see you at the bottom.

I&#x27;m sorry. I love you. I do. Shit. Wait. Did I just confess my love. Fuck.

Okay. Well, I guess this letter is not getting sent to you. I&#x27;ll let it rot in the bottom of my desk drawer, because I think it would hurt you more to see this. 

Fuck. I&#x27;ll just let the video message do the talking. This letter isn&#x27;t necessary anyways, I&#x27;m probably just being melodramatic.

Ah. 
Fuck.

I really do wish you would stop sending me letters, I&#x27;m sure [[Dylan-&gt;Start]] has already asked you multiple times to stop messaging me. I do not want to accept your Facebook invitation to play Farmville, Uncle Henry it is 2017, no one plays Farmville anymore. I understand that I am no longer with Dylan, and that I am therefore single, but you need to understand how //profoundly// strange it is that you have sent me letters professing your love. I did not want to receive the pictures of you in your speedo from my wedding with Dylan, that was far more than I ever wished to see of you. 

If you write me again, I will be forced to contact my lawyer. 

Nishat</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name="morning" tags="" position="238,312">//To the rising sun that wakes me every morning://

The orange bars that slip through my window&#x27;s blinds every morning are such a heavenly sight. I know you do not love me, I know you touch the hearts of others more worthy, but I still sit here stealing your warmth. 

//Ah, but don&#x27;t you think, none of us are worthy?//

The tsunami of warmth that transcends the cold air today, that radiates from our little star, that touches my gold face, it is so good. It is just so good. I am in love.

//I wish you would at least say sorry, for being so beautiful, for never being truly mine.//

I know I am one of the few you do not wish to touch. But, you do touch the hearts of my beautiful friends, at least, and for that I am grateful. My friends deserve far more from me than I have ever given them, so I am blessed to know that at least our star, that yellow star, has not forsaken them. [[They deserve so much-&gt;friends]]. I am sitting under cold flourescent lights this cold autumn morning. And I am thinking of [[her-&gt;clare]].

//Do you hear me? I whisper to you every day, I wish you would hear me.//

I am quiet today. I am patient today. I eagerly await your response.

Nishat</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="4" name="clare" tags="" position="405,448">//Clare// 

When I was taken away, first by my depression, and then by my [[family-&gt;family]], you fought harder than anyone I have ever seen. You were a monster, a beautiful, curly haired, green eyed monster. You are braver, stronger, and more powerful than anyone I have ever met. 

I don&#x27;t give you enough credit.

This is a letter that I have written to you, in an attempt to reiterate how sorry I am for abandoning you in a moment when you needed me. 

I know you noticed how distant I have been these past few days, that I am at the gates of a depressive hell all over again. You watch me fight and you watch me suffer, and you always hold me up. 

//And I returned the love by running away.//

I am, to be abrupt, a shitty human sometimes. I romanticize and idealize myself to the point where I am my own hero, that I owe no one nothing. And it&#x27;s true, I don&#x27;t owe anyone anything - but that does not mean for a second that I don&#x27;t have a duty to the love I have: I am beholden to the love that lives inside me, I owe this love a good home. So it&#x27;s true, I don&#x27;t owe anyone anything, but I owe myself the right of giving love to my friends in a way they deserve to be loved.

Ah, I&#x27;m not making any sense anymore. I guess, by the nonsense I&#x27;ve just spewed, I&#x27;m trying to say the only people I owe anything to are the people I truly love. 

I know when I abandoned you last night, I hurt you in a place that harbors a lot of hurting. And it wasn&#x27;t until later that night, that I realized I had been hitting that one spot a lot. You are so beautiful. You don&#x27;t deserve that.

I don&#x27;t have words for you, because sorry is not enough. I could go on for a long time, I could keep saying words, but as I go on, I realize words are not enough.

I am sorry. I love you.
Nishat</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="5" name="family" tags="" position="631,322">//Hello, to my beautiful family://

It&#x27;s a cold day, but the [[sun-&gt;morning]] is shining. Sorry Amo, I did not wear a winter jacket today, I know I have a cough and that it will get worse if I do not bundle up, but hey! I did pack some tea for myself! I do believe that is better than nothing.

I am writing you for a reason, but I would like to hold off on it for as long as possible.

Saima, how are you? I know Honors Literature is kicking your butt right now, but I honestly think you will be fine - you are easily the smartest out of any of us.

Bhaiya, how is that gaming system thing going? I know you have been investing in lots of different video games lately, I know you usually leave me out because things are too weird between us anymore for us to be casual.

Ah. Now I&#x27;m getting into the weird parts. Things //are// weird between us. Not just you and me, Bhaiya, but also all of us. Amo, Abu. Bhaiya, Saima. 

//Dhuukitoh.//

My loved ones, I am depressed and I am anxious. You know this, you tried to help, you tried to love the depression away. And for that I am appreciative, although I did not show even the smallest semblance of gratitude. I am so sorry I did not acknowledge you more.

So, I do not know what to apologize for beyond that, and yet I feel there is so much I must apologize for. It might be my ego, I don&#x27;t know. And, at the same time, I argue to myself that I deserve an apology more from you than you do from me. 

You all took a part in the efforts to put me away, to take me away. I know you all hate her, but I am thankful to [[Clare-&gt;clare]] for all that she did to save me. Because, yes, she did //save me//. She saved me from your clutches, from your efforts to force me to conform. 

I still have nightmares about the things you all did. I wake up gasping, only to see the sun waking me. The visions of tired nurses, of the drug addict vomiting blood in a corner, of the lady threatening homicide to the head doctor, these visions, I still see them every day, and I want you to remember every day that it is because of you that I see these images. 

Ah. This was supposed to be an apology for the times I messed up towards you and I am still screaming at you. 

Ah.

In my defense, what you did is far worse than the anger I&#x27;ve displayed towards you. I said some cruel words, but you did some cruel things. 

Ah.

Another letter gone to waste. 

I will probably not send this one.

Nishat</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="6" name="friends" tags="" position="238,462">//Hello friends, you goddamn beautiful works of art//

I&#x27;m sorry I am such a melodramatic piece of shit. Hahah, I prooomise I do try really hard to avoid drama, but it just happens!! It just fuckin happens. But hey, it does make for some interesting stories, doesn&#x27;t it? 

Y&#x27;all, I just wanna say thank you first, for being so goddamn lovely to me all the time. 
Abby, you&#x27;re my favorite person, and honestly if we were attracted to each other, dude we&#x27;d be such a power couple. But alas, you&#x27;re straight as HECK and I&#x27;m just piece of bi shit. 
Lena, you&#x27;re so innumerably lovely, omfg, you&#x27;re always so sweet to me, and like... we&#x27;re kind of the same person??? I love you more and more every day, which is kind of impossible but also true, and you&#x27;re just... fucking incredible and my favorite person. 
Anna, you&#x27;re so weird, but I&#x27;m weirder and I&#x27;m so glad you put up with me and I&#x27;m so glad you put up with the fact that I clUNG TO YOU SO HARDCORE FROM THE MOMENT WE MET IN PHYSICS LAB LOL. I love you so much it just kinda hurts, like you are my favorite person. (I&#x27;m noticing everyone is my favorite person, is this possible???? How????????)
[[Clare--&gt;clare]] You know who you are to me. I can&#x27;t really say much to you right now because I am just mad at myself for how I treated you. I just want you to know that I do love you, that the connection between us is deeper than either of us know. You are my friend, my sister, a part of my soul, and I love you.

I am such a fucking mess all the time, I am constantly breaking my own heart or the hearts of others, and you are somehow all with me. Still. I don&#x27;t know why y&#x27;all keep making the same mistakes over and over again, but hahaha I&#x27;m so glad you do!!

But, jokes aside.

I&#x27;m so blessed. I&#x27;m so sorry for the shit I put you all through sometimes, because I forget that I have an effect of people. I forget, I am oblivious, and just totally inept. You all deserve better, but I can&#x27;t lie and say that I&#x27;m not blessed to have you all choose me again and again.

I love you all, you are the reason I have survived this year. Really. You are all the reason. 

Love,
Nishat</tw-passagedata></tw-storydata>
